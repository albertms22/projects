# Samba & OpenVPN Auto-Setup Script

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üìñ Overview

This project provides a Bash script that automates the setup and configuration of:
  - Samba ‚Üí for local file sharing
  - OpenVPN ‚Üí for secure remote access
It is designed for Ubuntu/Debian-based systems and aims to simplify a process that usually requires many manual steps.

In addition to the script, the repository also includes ready-to-use configuration files. These are useful if you prefer to handle the installation and setup manually, without running the script.
