# 🏖️ Sandbox

Welcome to my digital playground.  
This repo is where I toss ideas, test experiments, and break things on purpose.  

Not everything here will be polished or finished — that’s the point.  
Some projects are prototypes, some are learning exercises, and some are just for fun.  

## What you'll find here
- 🌱 Early-stage ideas and experiments  
- 🛠️ Small tools and utilities  
- 🚀 Prototypes that may (or may not) grow into full projects  
- 🎲 Random side quests in code  

## Notes
- Expect rough edges, TODOs, and half-baked ideas.  
- Feel free to explore, fork, or laugh at my experiments.  
- If something looks interesting, it might evolve into its own repo later.
